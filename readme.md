This project is designed to show the user how to do the following:

1) Pull data from a public source in a replicitable way.
2) Create a logistic regression model and pipe that model. Pickle the piped model so it can be used again 
3) Use the test file to see if your pipe and pickle was successful.

To begin you must pip install the following packages (you will import specifics from each package later):
  Sklearn
  Pandas
  Pyad
  usbclassifier
  
      Step 1) Pull data from a public source in a replicitable way.
                  -> The code in the Pickling_Lab.ipynb file walks through pull data from a public site.
           
      Step 2) Create a logistic regression model and pipe that model
                  -> The code below step one in Pickling_Lab.ipynb walks through how to set up a model and pipe that model.
                  
      Step 3) Pickle the piped model so it can be used again 
                  -> This step is still in progress and not currently functionable.
